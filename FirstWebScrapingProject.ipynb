    "#### The code above creates a dataframe from the list created from the last problem. The columns for this new dataframe are id, name, text, quantity, unit, and ingredient and each row represents an ingredient for a recipe. Furthermore, one issue that I cannot easily solve is that the formatting for each ingredient text was not consistent. It was generally the case that for each ingredient's text, the property of quantity was listed first, followed by the unit, and then the ingredient name, with each property being one word or number. As a result, in order to retrieve these property values for an ingredient, I generally used the positioning of the words in the text. However, some did not follow this format by mixing up the order of these properties and others had multiple words or numbers for a single property that I could not easily take into account since my code assumes that a single property corresponded with a single word or number. Similarly, another issue I could not easily solve was that some ingredients didn't even list a quantity. As a result of these issues, some ingredients in my dataframe don't have the right values for certain columns/properties. Additionally, I was not able to scrape every recipe due to inconsistent recipe page formats and so the dataframe only contains 53 recipes. Some rows from the dataframe are printed above as well."
